As of 0.0.1:
  For 0.0.2:
  - Add config file support
    - JSON: Make three types of drops:
    {
      "SpawnerDropper is setup":true,
      
      "Creeper explosion drop":true,
      "TNT explosion drop":true,
      "Player break drop":false,
      
      "Drop chance from creeper explosion":45,
      "Drop chance from TNT explosion":10,
      "Drop chance from player breaking spawner block":1,
    }
    - Print message to server and command line if the config file doesn't work.
    - On first run, see if can open ./SpawnerDropperConfig.json, if can't or if !{SpawnerDropper is setup}, then
      take the above template and write it to ./SpawnerDropperConfig.json
  - Drop the spawner of type
  
  For 0.1.0:
  - All of the above
  - In game/console commands to change configuration files in game.
    - Will have to use permissions.
  
  - Obfuscated class for developer? "io.github.casnix.spawndropper.DeveloperPropClass"?
    - Maybe this should be saved for the Casnix Plugin System (CPS).  This way could also add other users.
    - Maybe save this for pro money plugins to be able to combat piracy.  Would also have to set up a server for logging
